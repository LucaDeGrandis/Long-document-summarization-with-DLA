**Increased Awareness and Commitment to Net Zero**

The year 2021, particularly marked by the COP26 conference, signified a pivotal moment in global climate awareness. The realization that immediate action is necessary to combat climate change has been widely acknowledged. This awareness has translated into tangible commitments, with half of the global asset management industry now part of the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative. This initiative represents a collective effort to align investment portfolios with the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Additionally, the establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation is a significant milestone. This board aims to standardize sustainability disclosures, providing investors with the critical financial information needed to make informed decisions.

**Economic Transformation and Challenges in Data Availability**

The transition to a net zero society is expected to drive an economic transformation akin to the industrial revolutions of the past. This shift will be propelled by advancements in technology and digitalization, fundamentally altering business models. As the global economy moves away from carbon-intensive practices towards a circular model, the availability of both financial and extra-financial data becomes crucial. However, the current landscape is fraught with challenges, particularly in terms of data availability and the need for harmonized standards. The lack of comprehensive disclosure requirements that address broader sustainability issues, such as inequality and human rights, further complicates the transition.

**DWS's Net Zero Strategy and Targets**

DWS has set ambitious targets to achieve net zero emissions, both in its operations and investment portfolios, by 2050. As part of the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative, DWS has developed a robust interim target framework for 2030. This includes managing 35.4% of its total global Assets under Management, equivalent to EUR 281.3 billion, towards net zero by 2030. The company aims to achieve a 50% reduction in Weighted Average inflation-adjusted financial Carbon Intensity related to Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 2030, compared to the base year 2019. These targets reflect DWS's commitment to aligning with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5Â°C and demonstrate a proactive approach to climate action.

**Active Ownership and Engagement with Investee Companies**

Active ownership is a cornerstone of DWS's strategy to support the transition to a net zero economy. In 2021, DWS engaged with over 500 companies, exercising its voting rights to influence corporate behavior. The company voted in favor of 94% of climate-focused resolutions in the US and 92% in Europe, surpassing the average among Net Zero Asset Manager initiative signatories. This engagement is not limited to voting; DWS also conducts direct, outcome-oriented discussions with investee companies to drive real-world change. By leveraging its influence as a shareholder, DWS aims to encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and align with net zero targets.

**Challenges in Reporting and Data Disclosure**

Despite progress in climate awareness and action, significant challenges remain in the realm of reporting and data disclosure. Current requirements are largely focused on climate-related risks, neglecting broader sustainability issues such as inequality and human rights. This narrow focus limits the ability of investors to fully understand the impact of their investments. To address this, there is a pressing need for harmonized and internationally compatible standards for taxonomies, disclosures, and benchmarks. Such standards would provide a comprehensive framework for assessing sustainability risks and opportunities, enabling more informed investment decisions.

**DWS's Internal and External Climate Actions**

Internally, DWS is committed to reducing its operational CO2 footprint. The company is undertaking a comprehensive analysis of its emissions and exploring ways to reduce them through cultural changes and partnerships with vendors. Externally, DWS is aligning its emission reduction targets with the Science Based Targets initiative, which provides a credible framework for setting science-based targets. By integrating sustainability into its corporate DNA, DWS aims to lead by example, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve financial success while contributing to a sustainable future.
